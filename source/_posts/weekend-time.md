## "Weekend!!" - What comes to your mind after reading this word??

### Party/ Night-out/Hanging out/ Free time???

Yes, that's all the activities which many of us think when we talk about **Weekend**.
But, as far as my experience speaks, we should do some sort of learning too, as we have more free time and our mind is much more vulnerable to doing tasks in free time.

Unlike all days, Weekends are considered more favorable as we have the time to focus on the things which we can't do on normal days!

But, if you ask me, Weekends should be made productive as we can invest and dedicate some time on the things which we are not able to on normal days.
Like, for example, if you are a self learner, you can put in your time to study and research the things you would like to study. (Now, don't say that you like to party and you hence you invest your time on partying on weekends!! LOL).
Seriously speaking, we can party and enjoy the time as it is also needed as we are a social being.

Learning new things and living the life you want to, actually refreshes your mind and hence makes you feel better and relieves the depression. Learning doesn't mean you have to study, learning is anything like, if you have passion for music, art, photography, etc. you can learn it and cherish your life with it. Now is the time, you can distinct yourself from world and achieve something you were always thinking of.

I just live on a quote simply, do what your heart says, and live happily. But that doesn't mean, you blindly follow and do on your own. Taking advise from the experienced people is a must and we should adhere to it, as discipline is also necessary to live a well polished life.

If you need to be successful, you need to do something extra and work an extra mile from other people, that can be achieved by investing more time to the things you would love to do.

And I think, Weekends can provide us that!
